<Project> Challenge2: Advanced CSS Portfolio

<Description> Future employers will want to view my deployed portfolio of work samples so they can determine whether or not I can fulfill their position requirements.

<Exit Criteria>
1. Upon loading my Github pages URL in a browser, you will observe my name, photo/avatar, and links to sections: about me, work examples, and my contact information.
2. When clicking a link on the nav-menu, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
3. When clicking a work exmaple, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
4. One of the work examples is larger than the others
5. the work example images once clicked take the user to the deployed applications
6. the user will experience a responsive design on smaller devices

<Methodology> Initially I took pen to paper to draw the design of the "containers" and their associated elements. A mock-up of the design was created in Figma. Admittedly I struggled with position placement of block/section/container and how to manipulate those elements to fit my design layout. As a result I started working on the html code first and then adding style to CSS.
when I got "stuck" which was often, I asked for help from my Inst/TA/ and my tutor. The operations tempo of the program, has had an affect on my ability to solidily grasp position placement via CSS. As such I tried to be creative in other ways. At one point my profile image was a favorite meme image of April from Parks and Rec. Unfortunately, my lack of expertise in position placement caused a major hiccup in block/container boundaries and I had to replace the image with a simpler one.

<Learning> For the most part, I have addressed this section; however, there were several times during the week that I felt utterly discouraged by the fact that I am uncomfortable with advanced CSS. Yes, I have identified a huge weakness and I'm not quite sure how to overcome it. I suppose I could spend additional hours on youtube when I'm not otherwise attending office hours, instruction, or spinning my wheels on this project. Highly recommend adding another week for advanced CSS learning.

<Credits> Max Oshawa - TA with extraordinary patience; Benjamin Wright - Instructor; and a brilliant tutor whom will go unnamed ...a regret for not requesting tutoring last week.
